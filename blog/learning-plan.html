    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
</header>
    <p><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></p>

    <p>My long term goal is to be able to do freelance work 2-3 days a week and have the rest of the week off to take care of my family and house. My more mid-term goal is to get a job either freelance or with a company that allows me to work from anywhere, still only working a few days per week or 2 weeks on 2 off. My dream is to travel the world and see all that life has to offer.</p>
   
    <p><b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</b></p>
    
    <p>I think that my main strengths are patience and the willingness to ask questions and try new things. These will help a lot with my learning journey because there will always be something I don’t know or a problem I just can’t solve, and having the patience to try figure it out myself first no matter how frustrated I am, then having the willingness to ask for help even if I feel stupid will help make sure I never get stuck on a problem for too long, or get too stressed and give up. The biggest limitation for me is focus. I've always struggled with focusing and paying full attention to the task at hand, even when I’m really into it. This can be attributed to many things but in the end it’s just something I need to work on, and figure out what learning style works best for me.</p>
    
    <p><b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></p>
     
    <p>The main non-tech skill I would like to develop is to do with career-finding, mainly the interview process. I’ve always been horrible at interviews and forget what my strengths, weaknesses, skills and so on are due to my nerves and pressure. Another thing I’d like to develop would be my communication skills. I’ve always been an introverted person and don’t always take the initiative when in a group, I typically find myself laying low and just going with the flow. So I would like to gain more confidence and develop the ability to communicate well no matter who I’m with.</p>
   
    <p><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</b></p>
   
    <p><b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</b></p>
    
        <p>I will manage myself by always being kind and straight-forward, making sure that people are comfortable working with me and understand me clearly. I will make sure that I stay productive and carry my weight so that when we work in groups I don’t slow the whole group down and ruin it for them. Finally I will be respectful to the facilitators and listen intuitively when they give me advice or criticism, learning from my mistakes instead of stubbornly believing they are wrong or misjudged me.</p>
    
    <p><b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b></p>
    
    <p>When things get too overwhelming I will take a break and go outside for a while, maybe throw a ball for my dog or go for a stroll around the neighborhood. When things get really stressful I will go to a family member and ask them for some help to calm down. This is what I’ve been doing so far and it works well enough for me.</p>
   
    <p><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b></p>
    
    <p>Whenever I need help I will ask google first, then ask the discord if I can’t find the answer there. It has worked like a charm so far.</p>
   
    <p><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</b></p>
    
    <p>I expect them to be understanding and patient when a student just can’t grasp something no matter how hard they try, and I expect them to help when asked, be non-judgemental, and treat everyone equally. I also expect them to stand up for themselves if need be and not accept rude remarks or people just because they are a facilitator.</p>
  
    <p><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</b></p>

    <p>None for now, typically things just spontaneously happen and I find a way to make time for them. I have no other commitments for the duration of this course.</p>
