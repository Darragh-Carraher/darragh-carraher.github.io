<p><b>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. </b></p>
<p>The most simple analogy I can think of is a car. CSS is the paint job and custom rims for your car, HTML is the body of the car (windows, doors, chassis, wheels, etc) and JavaScript is the engine, electronics, and fuel. So CSS is what styles the car and makes it look nice, HTML is the main body of the car and is what holds everything together, and JavaScript is what actually makes the car work and drive.

<p><b>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life. 
</b></p>
<p>Control flow is the order in which code is used on a document/file. Loops are a type of code used to make things repeat until your desired amount is reached. For example, when making bread, you have a list of ingredients that you will need to mix together. But you can’t just throw everything into a bowl, mix it, then chuck it in the oven. You need to “control your flow” so that everything works together properly. For example, you first need to pour your flour through a sieve to make sure it’s all the same consistency, then mix in your salt and yeast. Then you add whatever your liquids are (milk for pancakes, water for bread, etc) and add in your egg if it’s needed. Then you mix that all together to make a dough, but you can't just mix it, no, for most breads you need to knead the dough to aerate it, then let the gluten form. Here’s where the loops come in, while kneading, you typically knead until the dough is nice and stretchy, not too wet but not too dry. To make sure of this, sometimes you need to add a bit more flour or water as you’re kneading. In code, we would create a <b>if/else</b> loop so that <b>if</b> the dough is too dry, add water, <b>else if</b> dough is too wet, add flour, <b>else</b> finish kneading and let rise. Now, if you want to make this bread mulitple times, you use a <b>for</b> loop to repeat these actions until you run out of ingredients or reach the desired amount of bread.</p>




<p><b>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. 
</b></p>
<p>The DOM is the Document Object Model, and is an extremely helpful tool to use while coding with JavaScript. You may remember using “ctrl shift I” in intermediate or high school to change the words on a page to say that you’ve got 20/20 on your test instead of the 5/20 that you actually got (no? Just me?) Well, that is the DOM. An example of how you might interact with it while coding is using the console.log command. Typically while you code, you can’t see what changes your code is making in real time, so to help with this, you can frequently use console.log to see what changes you’ve made and how they've affected your code. To access the console, press “ctrl shift I” then click on the “Console” button right beside “Elements” and “Sources”.

<p><b>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. 
</b></p>
<p>Arrays and objects can be similar, but a big difference is that arrays are used to hold multiple items/values of the same kind, whereas objects are used to hold multiple items that are different enough that they need to have separate names/ID’s, but similar enough that they can all be grouped together. Arrays are actually a kind of object in a way, but arrays use numbered indexes and objects use named indexes. </p>



<p><b>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</b></p>
<p>In the simplest terms, functions used to take in data, process it, then return it. For example, if you want to write a simple function to add two numbers together, the code might look like:  
  function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2
}
</p>
<p>If you did 1 + 2 instead of num1, num2, the answer you would get is 3. The return part is the most important, without returning, the function won’t give you back an answer. They are mainly useful because they are reusable and help organise your code.</p>
