    <h1><b>EQ vs IQ</b></h1>
  <h2><b>Similarities, Differences, Uses</b></h2>
    </header>

    
<p>IQ and EQ are very different, but are also very similar in certain ways. IQ is the test of your intelligence quotient, or in other words, how well you can think logically, solve problems, and oftentimes how good your memory is.
</p>
<p>Originally, a person's IQ was calculated by dividing their mental age (acquired through all sorts of tests) by their physical age, then multiplying by 100. For example if a 10 year old had a mental age of 14, their IQ would be 140 (14/10 x 100). Nowadays the IQ is tested by taking the test-takers score and comparing it to other scores around their age group.
</p>
<p>Even so, there are many different types of IQ tests that test different types of thinking. For example, some test your logic and reasoning, while others test problem solving ability, and others just test how good your short and long term memory are. So even today, there is no definite way to test a person's IQ accurately, and I doubt there will be for some time.
</p>

<p><b>EQ</b></p>
<p>EQ on the other hand is another form of “intelligence” similar to IQ, but instead of being more capable of understanding logical things like arithmetic and problem-solving, EQ is centred towards understanding/managing your own and other people's emotions and how well you can connect and relate to others. 
</p>
<p>Quite a few studies (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-emotional-intelligence-more-important-than-iq-khaleel-shaik#:~:text=While%20IQ%20(Intelligence%20Quotient)%20is,in%20life%20than%20your%20IQ." target="_blank">LinkedIn,</a><a href="https://www.agilemeridian.com/blog/why-ei-is-more-important-than-iq" target="_blank"> AgileMeridian,</a><a href="https://owlcation.com/social-sciences/Why-Emotional-Intelligence-is-More-Important-Than-IQ" target="_blank"> Owlcation</a>) suggest that a high emotional intelligence is more beneficial not only in the workplace, but also in your day to day life. To me, a major reason why EQ can be considered more important than IQ is because at a fundamental level, humans are social creatures. The reason we have evolved into such an advanced and dominant species is because (among many things) we evolved to work together in large groups to tackle problems that we never could have overcome by ourselves, or in small groups like other great apes (e.g hunting/defending against large animals).
</p>
<p>So, using that logic it makes sense that the ability to understand and relate to other people, and the ability to regulate and understand emotions can be extremely helpful in our society. 
</p>

<p><b>WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM.</b></p>
<p>There are ways to improve both EQ and IQ, and it is highly recommended that everyone tries their hand at doing so. For EQ, the easiest way to start (in my opinion) is to try meditating for 15 minutes, morning and night, just letting your mind wander and let thoughts drift by.
</p>
<p>Meditation can seem daunting for people because of the way the media portrays it, like you have to be perfectly serene with a clear mind and straight back. All you need to do is find a comfortable position and relax yourself. Doing breathwork can help people get into it, by focusing on taking deep steady breaths, in through the nose out through the mouth, you can slowly clear away thoughts and just focus on the in and out, up and down.
</p>
<p>A few ways to improve your IQ are doing memory exercises, doing problem-solving games like word-cross and sudoku, or even learning a new language. Like I said before, there is no real quantifiable way to calculate IQ, but doing brain exercises and just learning new things in general can definitely help improve your cognitive ability and overall smarts.
</p>

<p><b>CONCLUSION.</b></p>
<p>In conclusion, IQ and EQ are both very important in any circumstance you may find yourself in, and ranking one above the other is a pointless endeavour. They are different things with different uses and you should try your best to improve both. I’d rather be a jack of all trades, master of none, than a master of one with no diversity in my knowledge.
