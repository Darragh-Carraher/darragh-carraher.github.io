    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
</header>

<p><b>Neuroplasticity</p></b>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganise and adapt by forming new neural connections, and has revolutionised our understanding of the human brain. Once believed to be static and unchangeable after a certain age, research has shown that the brain remains remarkably malleable throughout life. I believe that this misconception comes from the fact that your frontal lobe becomes fully developed from about 20-30 years of age, making people think that the entire brain stops developing. Neuroplasticity is driven by experiences, learning, and environmental factors, constantly shaping the neural bonds in response to stimuli. The implications of neuroplasticity extend beyond recovery from brain injuries to everyday learning and cognitive development. It suggests that intentional efforts to engage in new experiences, acquire new skills, and challenge oneself mentally can lead to significant changes in the brain. This highlights the potential for continual growth and development, challenging the idea that intelligence is a fixed trait.</p>
<p>The human brain is an engineering marvel and should not be underestimated. Neuroscientists have claimed for decades that the brain is malleable and can learn new things no matter how old you get. It is only in more recent times with new technology that we have seen substantial evidence for this claim.</p> 
<p>Also, through recent studies with psychedelic compounds, scientists have found that psychedelics can lead to rapid neuronal excitation (neural communication), generation of new synapses (help connect neurons), and changes in the dendritic arbour (neuron ‘branches’). Psychedelics have commonly been known to create euphoric “life changing” experiences that make you see the world in a different light or realise some truth that you never may have thought of while sober. For a long while, we had no real idea of why this happened, but recently there has been more and more approval by governments for the research of these substances (e.g Australia allowing research of MDMA and psilocybin) which has led to new breakthroughs. I hope that more governments allow psychedelic research as it has many mental health benefits if used correctly and could lead to new breakthroughs in neuroscience as a whole.</p>
<p>There are also mushrooms without psilocybin that can aid in neural development and growth, and even fight off alzheimers. For example, according to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lions-mane-mushroom#dementia" target="_blank">Healthline</a> the Lions Mane (Hericium erinaceus) and the nz version, Pekepeke-Kiore (Hericium Novae-Zealandiae) contain two special compounds that can stimulate the growth of brain cells: hericenones and erinacines. A 2020 study of people with mild Alzheimer’s disease found that supplementation with 1 gram of lion’s mane mushroom daily for 49 weeks significantly improved cognitive test scores compared with a placebo.

<p><b>Growth Mindset</b></p>
<p>A growth mindset is a way of thinking in which abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, effort, and resilience. In contrast, a fixed mindset is the belief that intelligence is static and predetermined, leading people to avoid challenges, give up easily, and view effort as fruitless. People with a growth mindset embrace challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, they persist in the face of failure, seeing it as a valuable lesson rather than a reflection of their incompetence. This mindset not only enhances motivation and resilience but also can create a love for learning and a willingness to take on new challenges.</p>
<p>This greatly applies to coding/programming because it is an ever-changing field that you need to struggle to keep up with or you’ll get left behind. Programmers need to be resilient problem-solvers that are always up for a challenge and don’t give up at the first sign of danger. I will try my best to keep a growth mindset during my programming career and my life in general because it is a great mindset to have and I see no cons to it.</p>

<p><b>Te Whare Tapa Whā</b></p>
<p>Te Whare Tapa Whā is a concept of wellbeing created by Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to input a Māori perspective on health and wellbeing in a time where there was very little Māori representation. It is made up of 4 dimensions that encompass your general wellbeing. Taha tinana (physical wellbeing), taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing), taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing), and taha whānau (family wellbeing).</p>

<p><b>Here is my wellbeing plan using this method:</b></p>
<p><b>Taha Tinana:</b> Swim 2 mornings a week with my brother for 30-60 mins. Run 2 mornings a week with my brother. Workout 2 mornings a week with my brother. Stretch every morning and night for at least 10 mins.</p>
<p><b>Taha Hinengaro:</b> Meditate morning and night. Be mindful and not be harsh on myself, instead encourage myself to keep going.</p>
<p><b>Taha Wairua:</b> Wairua and Hinengaro are pretty much the same thing to me.</p>
<p><b>Taha Whānau:</b> Spend more time with my parents, try to eat dinner together as often as we can. Spend more time bonding with my family, maybe go out on hikes and go camping together. Especially with my brother.</p>
