    <h1>My Identity, Values, and Strengths.</h1>
</header>
    <p><b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</b></p>

    <p>One time I was camping at Ring’s Beach in the Coromandel and me and all the boys that we came with went for a swim at the ‘jump spot’ that they had been going to since they were little kids. We were all taking turns jumping off the rocks and having fun until the youngest of the boys, Nate, jumped in. Pretty much as soon as he hit the water me and my friend Jamie saw a huge fin breach the water, maybe 10 meters away, gliding towards Nate. We immediately panicked and screamed “SHARK”, yelling at Nate to get out of the water but he was a rather chubby kid for his height and that plus panicking made it so that he couldn’t pull himself up and out of the water onto the rocks. At the rocks we were at you had to wait for a swell to pick you up a bit before climbing up, or else the swell pulled back and the rocks were above your head. So while Nate was panicking and everyone else froze up, I had the decision to either jump in and push him up or jump down the rocks and pull him up instead. Jumping in behind him may have been the more selfless decision, but I chose to jump down the sharp rocks and try to pull him up and out of the water. I got him up quickly but not easily, he weighed more than me at the time and the swell was out as I tried to pull him. As I was pulling him out, the ‘shark’ swam up and brushed past Nate with a boop to the bum, and in that moment I felt relief because it was an Orca and her Calve, not a huge Great White. Reflecting on it now, we should have remained calm when we saw the fin and we would have easily seen that it was drooping and much thicker and rounder than a shark, we also would have seen the Calve right beside the mum which sharks don’t do. We also should have been more prepared because there had been shark sightings that day and we saw the orca pod swim past while we were jumping in.</p>

    <p><b>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</b></p>

<p>This may be too simple of an answer but we are products of our environment and the closest environment to me/the one that affects me the most is my family. My family are all very kind but have short anger fuses which makes me value patience a lot, and they are all very forgetful and struggle to stay on task (other than my dad). This has definitely helped shape my identity because I often find myself forgetting that I have something to do and I always struggle to stay focused on a task.</p>

<p><b>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</b></p>

<p>I think that my main strengths are patience and the willingness to ask questions and try new things. These will help a lot with my learning journey because there will always be something I don’t know or a problem I just can’t solve, and having the patience to try figure it out myself first no matter how frustrated I am, then having the willingness to ask for help even if I feel stupid will help make sure I never get stuck on a problem for too long, or get too stressed and give up.</p>

<p><b>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</b></p>

<p>The biggest limitation for me is focus. I've always struggled with focusing and paying full attention to the task at hand, even when I’m really into it.  This can be attributed to many things but in the end it’s just something I need to work on, and figure out what learning style works best for me.</p>

<p><b>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b></p>

<p>An easy example would be gardening with my brother. We were digging out weeds in an old veggie bed to make a new one when it suddenly started collapsing due to the wood rotting. I said that we should just ignore it and keep digging up the weeds, because we were going to move the soil anyway so the condition of the old wood didn’t matter (it also just turns into mulch for the soil). My brother insisted that we try holding the wood together with random objects while we de-weed so that we had a sturdy base to dig out of. So pretty much I said to leave it and he said to build a foundation of sorts which would just waste time. Instead of explaining our ideas and figuring out who had the better idea, we just ended up arguing and wasting even more time. Reflecting on it, I should have stayed patient and simply explained myself to him then let him explain his point and debate which is smarter for a few minutes. I also could have just let him do his thing and leave it be.</p>
