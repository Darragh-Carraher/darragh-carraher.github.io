    <p>One time I was camping at Ring’s Beach in the Coromandel and me and all the boys that we came with went for a swim at the ‘jump spot’ that they had been going to since they were little kids. We were all taking turns jumping off the rocks and having fun until the youngest of the boys, Nate, jumped in. Pretty much as soon as he hit the water me and my friend Jamie saw a huge fin pop out of the water, maybe 10 meters away, gliding towards Nate. We immediately panicked and screamed “SHARK”, yelling at Nate to get out of the water but he was a rather chubby kid for his height and that plus panicking made it so that he couldn’t pull himself up and out of the water onto the rocks. At the rocks we were at you had to wait for a swell to pick you up a bit before climbing up, or else the swell pulled back and the rocks were above your head. So while Nate was panicking and everyone else froze up, I had the decision to either jump in and push him up or jump down the rocks and pull him up instead. Jumping in behind him may have been the more selfless decision, but I chose to jump down the sharp rocks and try to pull him up and out of the water. I got him up quickly but not easily, he weighed more than me at the time and the swell was out as I tried to pull him. As I was pulling him out, the ‘shark’ swam up and brushed past Nate with a boop to the bum, and in that moment I felt relief because it was an Orca and her Calve, not a huge Great White. Reflecting on it now, we should have remained calm when we saw the fin and we would have easily seen that it was drooping and much thicker and rounder than a shark, we also would have seen the Calve right beside the mum which sharks don’t do. We also should have been more prepared because there had been shark sightings that day and we saw the orca pod swim past while we were jumping in.</p>
