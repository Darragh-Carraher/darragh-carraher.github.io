<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
  <p>Hello everyone my name is Darragh, I live in West Auckland and have lived here all my life, other than when I lived in Sweden for a year.</p>
  <p>I’m attending Dev Academy because ever since I was young my dream has always been to travel the world and get to experience all the different amazing things humanity has created, whether that’s culture, monuments, languages, or (especially) FOOD. I believe Dev Academy will help guide me to this dream because Software Development and the IT field in general seems to be a great way to travel while earning money, no matter where you are in the world.  I also love problem solving and racking my brain to try solve difficult things, and from my minimal experience it seems coding brings you a LOT of problems needing to be solved.</p>
    <p>A value that I hold in high regard is discipline. I have struggled with discipline for as long as I can remember, never being able to keep up with a hobby or schedule long enough for it to stick. It may seem a bit macho, but to me, a person with no discipline will never accomplish what they set out to achieve, and I hope that one day I attain the discipline to see my dream come true.</p>
    <p>I can’t wait to meet everyone in person and get to know you better. I hope you all have a wonderful 2024 and achieve what you set out to do.</p>
