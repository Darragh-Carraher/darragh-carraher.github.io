    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
</header>
<p>Display-inline and inline-block elements allow other elements to be beside them and only take up the space they are given, whereas display-block elements take up all the space that they can, forcing new elements below them.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, inline elements act like writing sentences on a piece of paper. You don't finish a sentence then go down to the next line, instead you keep writing until you reach the edge of the paper, then you start on a new line. Display-block elements do the opposite. Any time you want to write a new sentence it will bring you down to the next line instead of continuing where you were. This writing on the paper is the same as when coding HTML/CSS (and I'm sure it’s similar for many coding languages). Another way to view it is that display-block is an arrogant git and sticks out his elbows while puffing up his shoulders when people walk by to take up as much room in the walkway as possible.</p>
<p>The other main difference between display inline and inline-block is that with inline-block elements, you can change their height and width to your liking, whereas with inline elements you can only add padding and margins to the left and right, not top and bottom.</p>
<p>Inline-block elements on the other hand are the best of both worlds, as it has the “sharing” ability of inline elements with the “customising” ability of block elements. Meaning you can change its height, width, and so on while also allowing other elements to stay on the same line.</p>
