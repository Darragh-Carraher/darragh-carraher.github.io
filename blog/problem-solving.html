    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
</header>


<p><b>A time I was stuck on a simple problem:</b></p>
<p>I was stuck on the for and forEach loops for a while and just couldn’t wrap my head around it, I still don’t even really understand them now. I tried looking through loads of different websites and watched tutorials on youtube but for some reason the knowledge just wouldn’t compute in my brain.  I felt like I was stupid and should have understood it much easier, but I know that knowledge comes slowly and I shouldn’t get too stressed over it. In the end I did figure it out, but I didn’t really understand why/how the code worked, so I’ll definitely need to do more study.</p>

<p><b>A time I elegantly solved a problem:</b></p>
<p>This isn’t a specific problem and I haven’t “solved” it per se, but I have been really struggling with staying on task and completing things on time. It has prevented me from keeping up with the sprints and just adds on a lot of unneeded stress to an already stressful course. To combat this, I’ve tried using all sorts of different timing apps like Toggl, but It’s really easy to just ignore it so without proper discipline it doesn’t really work for me. The only thing that has worked well for me is focusing solely on one thing and fully finishing it before moving on, e.g focusing purely on the coding part of the sprint, then the written stuff, so my brain stays on the same wavelength. So pretty much, It’s an ongoing problem that I struggle with and I will keep trying to find ways of studying that suit me.</p>

<p><b>How confident I am using the problem-solving techniques we've been introduced to:</b></p>
<p>I’m pretty much at the same level of confidence with all of them, which is not very confident. I need to spend more time going over the techniques and actually using them day to day. Especially techniques that break down the problem into easier chunks.</p>

<p><b>A time I was reluctant to ask for help:</b></p>
<p>I have been reluctant to ask for help for the past week, even though I know I should, because I feel like I’m so far behind everybody else and the gap between us keeps getting wider. I’m reluctant to ask for help because I feel like I will be judged or told off for being behind and I know that it’s counter-intuitive but I want to try to figure it out on my own. I’ve gotten some help from a fellow student that helped boost me to completing the kata which was nice, and hopefully I’ll be able to bridge that gap before bootcamp starts. During bootcamp I’ll definitely be asking for help a lot more.</p>
